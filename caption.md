## 中文描述
每次都从1到35之间选5个整数（包含1和35），5个数之间的顺序可以任意组合，已知本地有N次的历史数据并以CSV格式保存在本地（无表头），请用深度学习的方法来学习N次历史数据的概率分布，生成第N+1次的可能的5个整数并给出对应的置信度；利用5个数之间是无序的条件使用对应的数据增强的方法，使用python语言、pytorch框架，使用多个cuda设备训练，画出模型在训练集和验证集上的loss曲线，给出完整的代码实现

### caption5
Choose 5 integers from 1 to 35 each time (including 1 and 35), the order of the 5 numbers can be combined arbitrarily, it is known that there are N times of historical data locally and save them locally in CSV format (no table head), please use the method of deep learning to learn the probability distribution of N times historical data, generate the possible 5 integers of the N+1th time and give the corresponding confidence; use the condition that the 5 numbers are disordered Use the corresponding data enhancement method, use python language, pytorch framework, use multiple cuda devices for training, draw the loss curve of the model on the training set and verification set, and give a complete code implementation

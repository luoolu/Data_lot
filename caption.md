## 中文描述
每次都从1到35之间选5个整数（包含1和35），5个数之间的顺序可以任意组合，已知本地有N次的历史数据并以CSV格式保存在本地，请用深度学习的方法来学习N次历史数据的概率分布，生成第N+1次的5个整数

### caption5
Choose 5 integers from 1 to 35 each time (including 1 and 35), and the order of the 5 numbers can be combined arbitrarily. It is known that there are N times of historical data locally and they are saved locally in CSV format. Please use The deep learning method is used to learn the probability distribution of N times historical data and generate 5 integers for the N+1th time
